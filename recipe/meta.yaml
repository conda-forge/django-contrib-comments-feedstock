  summary: 'The official Django comments framework'
  description: |
    Django used to include a comments framework; since Django 1.6 
    itâ€™s been separated to a separate project. This is that project.
    This framework can be used to attach comments to any model, so you 
    can use it for comments on blog entries, photos, book chapters, 
    or anything else.
